# seq_tools
Sequence analysis tools for various projects


This package includes a set of command line tools for DNA and protein sequence analysis that I have developed over the past twenty years. The tools are functional,
but not heavily documented or debugged. They are primarily intended for use as part of scripts that support various publications of mine, though you are
free to use them for other purposes.  The "INSTALL" file in the included tar gives installation instructions.
